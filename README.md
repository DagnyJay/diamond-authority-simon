The classic Simon memory game, with a Steven-Universe twist

### ___Background Info___
I have a real soft-spot for animated stuff, and Steven Universe (a gorgeously-animated show on Cartoon Network which follows the adventures of a young boy and his friends in space) is one of my favorites. A major story arc of the show is Steven and his friends attempting to save Earth from a dictortatorship of a technologically-advanced race of aliens, collectively referred to as "The Diamonds."

In this game, you are a doomed rebel, desperately trying to divert the Diamond Authority's attention from your cause. You can't win, but that doesn't mean you can't try :)

### ___Technologies Used___
Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### ___Getting Started___
Play my game here: https://dagnyjay.github.io/diamond-authority-simon/

It looks like this:

### ___Next Steps___
* I'm excited to learn more about CSS Grid. It works great in the desktop version, but the way the gridbox is laid out means that another sized screen would have issues playing my game (specifically, issues with the containers holding my images not mapping to the clickable area to select the image).  
* Somewhere to store high scores (right now, once the page refreshes there's no memory of previous games). 
* Some kind of win logic. Right now, you play until you lose. It'd be fun to have some kind of benchmark score that, once achieved, lets the player know they've aided their rebel cause but they can keep playing to further mess with The Diamonds.
